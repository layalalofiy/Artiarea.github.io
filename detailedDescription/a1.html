              <hr>
              <p class="text-justify">
                The Palace of Versailles is a former royal residence located in Versailles, 
                about 12 miles (19 km) west of Paris, France. The palace is owned by the French
                 Republic and has since 1995 been managed, under the direction of the French Ministry
                  of Culture, by the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles.
                   15,000,000 people visit the Palace, Park, or Gardens of Versailles every year, making it one of the most popular tourist
                    attractions in the world. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of paying visitors to the Château dropped by
                     75 percent from eight million in 2019 to two million in 2020. The drop was particularly sharp among foreign visitors, who
                      account for eighty percent of paying visitors.
                <br />
                <p>
                    Louis XIII built a simple hunting lodge on the site of the Palace of Versailles in 1623 and replaced it with a small
                     château in 1631–34. Louis XIV expanded the château into a palace in several phases from 1661 to 1715.
                      It was a favorite residence for both kings, and in 1682, Louis XIV moved the seat of his court and government to Versailles,
                       making the palace the de facto capital of France. This state of affairs was continued by Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI,
                        who primarily made interior alterations to the palace, but in 1789 the royal family and capital of France returned to Paris.
                         For the rest of the French Revolution, the Palace of Versailles was largely abandoned and emptied of its contents,
                          and the population of the surrounding city plummeted.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          The palace and park were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979 for its 
                          importance as the center of power, art, and science in France during the 17th and 18th centuries.
                           The French Ministry of Culture has placed the palace, its gardens, and some of its subsidiary structures
                            on its list of culturally significant monuments.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <hr>In 1623, Louis XIII, King of France, built a hunting lodge on a hill in a favorite hunting ground,
                 12 miles (19 km) west of Paris, and 10 miles (16 km) from his primary residence, the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
                  The site, near a village named Versailles, was a wooded wetland that Louis XIII's court scorned as being generally unworthy
                   of a king; one of his courtiers, François de Bassompierre, wrote that the lodge "would not inspire vanity in even the simplest
                    gentleman". From 1631 to 1634, architect Philibert Le Roy replaced the lodge with a château for Louis XIII,
                     who forbade his queen, Anne of Austria, from staying there overnight, even when an outbreak of smallpox at Saint-Germain-en-Laye
                      in 1641 forced Louis XIII to relocate to Versailles with his three-year-old heir, the future Louis XIV.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                When Louis XIII died in 1643, Anne became Louis XIV's regent, and Louis XIII's château was abandoned for the next decade.
                 She moved the court back to Paris, where Anne and her chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, continued Louis XIII's unpopular
                  monetary practices. This led to the Fronde, a series of revolts against royal authority from 1648 to 1653 that masked a struggle
                   between Mazarin and the princes of the blood, Louis XIV's extended family, for influence over him. In the aftermath of the 
                   Fronde, Louis XIV became determined to rule alone. Following Mazarin's death in 1661, Louis XIV reformed his government
                    to exclude his mother and the princes of the blood, moved the court back to Saint-Germain-en-Laye,and ordered the expansion
                     of his father's château at Versailles into a palace.
                <br>
                <br>
                Louis XIV had hunted at Versailles in the 1650s, but did not take any special interest in Versailles until 1661
                . On 17 August 1661, Louis XIV was a guest at a sumptuous festival hosted by Nicolas Fouquet, the Superintendent of Finances,
                 at his palatial residence, the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte. Louis XIV was impressed by the château and its gardens,
                  which were the work of Louis Le Vau, the court architect since 1654, André Le Nôtre, the royal gardener since 1657, and Charles Le Brun,
                   a painter in royal service since 1647. Vaux-le-Vicomte's scale and opulence inspired Louis XIV's aesthetic sense,
                    but also led him to imprison Fouquet that September, as he had also built an island fortress and a private army.
                     Louis XIV was also inspired by Vaux-le-Vicomte, and he recruited its authors for his own projects. Louis XIV replaced Fouquet
                      with Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a protégé of Mazarin and enemy of Fouquet, and charged him with managing the corps of
                       artisans in royal employment. Colbert acted as the intermediary between them and Louis XIV,who personally directed and
                        inspected the planning and construction of Versailles.
